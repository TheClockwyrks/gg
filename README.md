# gg

gg, the agent harness: its crates, the sandbox packages and SDKs of its program
languages, their toolchain installers, and its documentation.

This repository is one component of
[The Test Cabinet](https://github.com/TheClockwyrks/TheTestCabinet). What it is
and how it fits with the others is stated by the documentation site, which
lives in the superrepo at `apps/docs/src/content/docs/`. Its Repositories page,
`apps/docs/src/content/docs/development/repositories.md`, draws the edges
between the repositories.

gg's own section of that site lives here, in [`docs/`](docs/overview.md),
which the site reads from the superrepo's checkout of this repository.

## Getting started

Open the superrepo in its devcontainer, which carries every toolchain the
repositories need, and work from this repository's root.
A build here inherits the superrepo's Cargo configuration, which redirects
every dependency on another repository to the sibling checkout, so nothing is
fetched from a mirror.

One command runs every gate:

```sh
make gate
```

Each gate is a file under `ci/gates/` whose stem is the gate's id.
`uv run --quiet --project ci gate list` names them all, and
`azure-pipelines.yml` runs each one as a step of its own on every push, inside
the CI images the superrepo builds.
